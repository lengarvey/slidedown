# Write your presentations in Markdown

We believe presentations are:

1. Documents to be read.
2. Should be as accessible as possible.

Markdown lets us do this because it's the most accessible document
format we know of that still lets us create beatiful slides.

## The format

-----------------

The stuff between horizontal rules are slides

-----------------

* mark them up

**Just like you would regular markdown**

-----------------

Then simple style the resulting html

-----------------

We also support speaker notes.

> > Double nested block quotes are slide notes.
